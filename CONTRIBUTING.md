# Contributing Guidelines

If you really want to contribute, make a pull request.

Be warned, these are my own personal projects, so if you're adding a lot I will probably deny it.

If they're spelling mistakes that bug you a ton, feel free to submit the pull request and I'll make sure they get fixed XD
