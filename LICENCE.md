Ok this is made with the idea of reading CCP's sorta hashmap file system. With that in mind, if you do use this to read through CCP's files, you *must* follow their guidelines and policies.

Their policies can be found [here](https://community.eveonline.com/support/policies/).

CCP is nice and lets us use their in game assets to make cool art stuff, don't be a jerk and make them change that because you wanted to steal their intellectual property.
